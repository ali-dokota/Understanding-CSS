    <h1>A Short Story</h1>
    <p>
        In a small village,<b>Lily</b> found a tiny, <i>injured bird.</i> She named it <b>Sunny</b> and nursed it back to health. As <b>Sunny</b> grew stronger,
         Lily discovered its <i>magical ability</i> to bring sunshine on gloomy days. Word spread, and the village transformed into a cheerful place. 
         Grateful, the villagers celebrated Sunny, and <i>Lily's kindness</i> became legendary. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunny continued to <i>spread warmth,</i> reminding everyone that even a <b>small act of compassion</b> can brighten 
        the darkest days. Lily and Sunny's bond became a <b>symbol of hope,</b> turning their ordinary village 
        into an extraordinary place filled with joy.
