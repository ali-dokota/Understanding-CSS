    <h2>Impact of Colors</h2>
    <p>
        Color can play an important role in conveying information, creating certain moods,
         and even influencing the decisions people make. Color preferences also exert an influence
        on the objects people choose to purchase, the clothes they wear, and the way they adorn their
        environments.
